### Goal

Learn to use all the variables in python. This exercise has two parts. The first part will cover all the primitive data types and the second part will cover the advanced data types

#### PART I:

In this part we will declare all the variables of all the following primitive data types.

1. Integers
2. Character
3. Strings
4. Float

##### Task 1: Integers

Declare and initialize 10 integer variables with names int1, int2,... int10 and store the multiples of 5 in each variable and finally print them to the console in the following format:

```
int1 = 5
int2 = 10
int3 = 15
.
.
.
int10 = 55
```

##### Submission:

Please create git repo with name `py-var-hw` in your github account push the code to a feature branch with name `feature/part-1-task-1` and share the link for the pull request to master branch on slack.


##### Task 1: Strings

Declare and initialize 10 string variables with names str1, str2,... str10 and store either single or multiple words in each variable and finally print them to the console in the following format:

```
str1 = Contents of first string variable
str2 = happy christmas
str3 = Strings are kind of cool
.
.
.
str10 = this could be it
```

##### Submission:

Create a new feature branch with name `feature/part-1-task-2` and share the link for the pull request to master branch on slack.
